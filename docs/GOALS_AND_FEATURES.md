# Race Manager Pro — Goals and Features

## High-Level Goals
- **Purpose:** Race Manager Pro is an effective data browser for motorsport racing data, with an additional game element allowing users to simulate and play through complex races and championships.
- **Target Users:**
  - Gamers interested in motorsport
  - Race engineers and strategists (simulation and real-world)
- **Problem Solved:**
  - Existing motorsport management sims are too arcade-like and lack detail.
  - No current solution offers deep customisation of live race data viewing.

## Core Features (MVP)
- **Implemented:** Heavily customisable views of race data (widgets, layouts, dashboards)
- **Implemented (basic):** Simulation of races and championships
- **In Progress:** Real-time updates of all displayed data (UI is ready; live data integration pending)
- **Implemented:** Session summary and lap chart widgets (table and graph)
- **Implemented:** Edit mode is centrally managed and signal-based

## Nice-to-Have Features (Future)
- Integration with real-world and sim racing live data feeds
- 3D rendering/visualisation of simulated races

## User Experience
- Users may need to invest effort to unlock the app’s full potential, but onboarding for new users is important.
- Experience is highly customisable: users can select and arrange the information most important to them.
- Main workflow: users prepare/edit views before a race, then use the displayed data to make strategic decisions during the race.

## Technical/Platform Requirements
- Desktop application (Windows, Mac, Linux fully supported)
- Investigate standards and formats for real-time race data (both real-world and sim racing)
